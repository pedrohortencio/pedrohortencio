> - 👨‍💻 Hi! I'm 22 yo and a Computer Engineering student at Federal University of Goiás (UFG).
> - :books: I had a class, at university, about Artificial Intelligence and I've become fascinated about the field. Since then, I did a lot of other courses, specializations and projects. The specializations I enjoyed the most was:
>   - :bar_chart: Applied Data Science with Python
>   -  🧠 TensorFlow Developer
>   -  🧠 TensorFlow Data and Deployment
>   - :cloud: Cloud Architect with Google Cloud Platform
> - Currently, I am doing some projects, specially Kaggle's ones.
>   - 🤺 The one that I'm more involved right now is a comparison between different algorithms in some pretty classic datasets. I kindly named it [Machine Learning Gladiator](https://github.com/pedrohortencio/machine-learning-gladiator).
> - :dancers: I'm interest in projects related to AI and/or DS. 
> - ⚡ Fun fact: I'm somewhat a reserved person, but I do like to talk about things that I find interesting. Besides tech-related things, the list includes dogs, cats, music, food, and games.
