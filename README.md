> - 👨‍💻 Hi! I'm 22 yo and a Computer Engineering student at Federal University of Goiás (UFG).
> - :books: I had a class at university about Artificial Intelligence and I've become fascinated about the field. Since then, I did some other courses, specializations and projects. The specializations I enjoyed the most was:
>   - :bar_chart: Applied Data Science with Python
>   -  🧠 TensorFlow Developer
>   -  🧠 TensorFlow Data and Deployment
>   - :cloud: Cloud Architect with Google Cloud Platform
> - Currently, I am doing some projects, specially Kaggle's ones.
>   - 🤺 The project that I'm more involved right now is a series of comparisons between different algorithms' scores in classic datasets. The goal is to explore how each model performs with out-of-the-box settings and with fine-tuning (Grid Search, hyperparameter tuning, transfer learning, etc) and compare the results. I kindly named it [Machine Learning Gladiator](https://github.com/pedrohortencio/machine-learning-gladiator).
> - :dancers: I'm interest in projects related to Artificial Intelligence and/or Data Science. 
> - ⚡ Fun facts: I have 2 cats and a dog and I love them. I'm also a big fan of music, food, and games, especially RPGs.
