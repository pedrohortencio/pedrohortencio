> - 👨‍💻 Hi! I'm 22 yo and a Computer Engineering student at Federal University of Goiás (UFG).
> - :books: I had a class at university about Artificial Intelligence and I've become fascinated about the field. Since then, I did some other courses, specializations and projects. The specializations I enjoyed the most was:
>   - :bar_chart: Applied Data Science with Python
>   -  🧠 TensorFlow Developer
>   -  🧠 TensorFlow Data and Deployment
>   - :cloud: Cloud Architect with Google Cloud Platform
> - Currently, I am doing some projects, specially Kaggle's ones.
>   - 🤺 I'm comparing and documenting how different algorithms performs in classic datasets. The goal is to explore how well the models perform with out-of-the-box settings and with fine-tuning (Grid Search, hyperparameter tuning, transfer learning, etc). I kindly named it [Machine Learning Gladiator](https://github.com/pedrohortencio/machine-learning-gladiator).
>   - :speech_balloon: I'm also exploring sentiment analysis using Neural Networks. I even built a notebook that classifies a review (or any sentence) into "Positive" or "Negative". It can be found and ran in this [Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/pedrohortencio/sentiment-analysis/blob/main/IMDB%20Reviews/Review_Analyzer.ipynb).
> - :dancers: I'm interest in projects related to Artificial Intelligence and/or Data Science. 
> - ⚡ Fun facts: I have 2 cats and a dog and I love them. I'm also a big fan of music, food, and games, especially RPGs.


### A *too long didn't read* version:
> * 22 yo
> * Interested in Data Science and Machine Learning, specially Computer Vision
> * Computer Engineering, UFG
> * :smile_cat: Loves cats 

## Current Projects

> - :grey_exclamation: I have a lot of problems opening the Jupyter Notebooks throughout GitHub. Very often I face the _"Sorry, something went wrong. Reload?"_ error. I learned to use the [NBViewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/), from the Project Jupyter, to visualize the content of a Jupyter Notebook hosted on GitHub (and other platforms). It's just a matter of pasting the notebook's URL in the site.
